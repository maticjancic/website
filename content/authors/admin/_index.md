I'm a teaching and research assistant at the [Department of Biodiversity](https://www.famnit.upr.si/sl/) at [University of Primorska](https://www.upr.si/) and [Blue World Institute of Marine Research and Conservation](https://www.blue-world.org/) and a PhD student of Biological Sciences. My research interest include biology and conservation of large marine vertebrates, with my PhD thesis focused on spatial ecology and conservation of loggerhead sea turtles in Adriatic Sea. Additionally I'm a huge fan of R programming and data analysis.
