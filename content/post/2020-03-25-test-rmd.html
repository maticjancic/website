<p>A couple of weeks ago, just before this current crisis with corona virus outbreak, I had yet another interesting and funny discussion with my friend Marko. He wanted to be a mathematician, but figured out that there is much more money in programming. So he learned it and landed a great job in a programming firm. He told me, not for the first time, that your personal website is the first thing you need to do if you want to be any kind of a programmer - you should try it :D With a bit of extra time being in home isolation, I decided - let’s do it then.</p>
<p>So, after a brief investigation on how to do it, I decided to use R as it is the only programming language I know how to use (so far). I figured out that there is everything in place for newbies like me, to do it fairly quickly and efficiently: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scholar/index.html">R</a> <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown package</a> in combination with <a href=".com">github</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/">academic template</a> and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a>.</p>
<p>The page is very rudimentary as are my web page editing skills, but will get better, or at least i hope so. <strong>So, thanks Marko for the encouragement!!</strong></p>
